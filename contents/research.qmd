## Publications

My research focuses on the development of methodologies for the analysis of functional data. I am also interested to apply these methodologies to diverse areas, such as sport science and ecology. Here are a list of my publications.

The emojis along the publications refer to:

`r library(fontawesome); fa("globe")` - link to the journal publication.

<i class="ai ai-arxiv"></i> - link to the arxiv publication.

<i class="ai ai-zotero"></i> - download the bibtex entry for this publication.

source("../code/functions_research.R")

# bibliography loading
bibliography <- read.csv("../data/bibliography.csv")

tagList(
  div(
    class = "grid",
    accordeon_mult_code(
       data = bibliography,
       id = "accordeon", 
       show = FALSE
    )
  ),
)
```
