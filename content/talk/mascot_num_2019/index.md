summary: A poster presentation about making groups in driving data.
abstract: "Nowadays, a vehicle records a lot of information about its environment through its different sensors (camera, radar and lidar). More particularly, it registers some characteristics about vehicles around him at high frequency. These characteristics can be the longitudinal and lateral position, the acceleration, the size and the type of vehicle for instance. All the information are recorded relatively to the considered vehicle. We define a driving scene as a small period during which we record the environment of the car. We aim to make groups in these scene."
