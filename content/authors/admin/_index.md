<div style="text-align:justify;">
I'm currently working as a research engineer at Group Renault, and I will soon complete a thesis in Statistics, Applied Mathematics about some methods on multivariate functional data. My lab is the CREST (Center for Research in Economics and Statistics). This work is supervised by Valentin Patilea (CREST, <a href="http://ensai.fr/equipe/valentin-patilea/">link</a>) and Nicolas Klutchnikoff (IRMAR, <a href="https://klutchnikoff.github.io">link</a>) and is realized part at Renault and part at ENSAI.
