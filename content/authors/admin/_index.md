<div style="text-align:justify;">
I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at the University of Limerick, Ireland, working on the Functional data Analysis for Sensor Technologies (FAST, <a href="https://www.insight-centre.org/harnessing-the-data-deluge-dr-norma-bargary-awarded-sfi-frontiers-for-the-future-grant/">link</a>) project. The aim of the project is to develop novel, computationally efficient statistical models and algorithms for the modelling of multivariate sensor data, while allowing for novel, individualised prediction and adaptive reference ranges. Examples of application include functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), accelerometer data in sports science, electrocardiogram (ECG) monitors in cardiology and IoT for e-health. This work is supervised by Norma Bargary (UL, <a href="https://www.ul.ie/research/dr-norma-bargary">link</a>) and Andrew Simpkin (NUI Galway, <a href="https://www.nuigalway.ie/our-research/people/andrewsimpkin/">link</a>).

## The PhD project
<div style="text-align:justify;">
I completed a thesis in Statistics, Applied Mathematics, entitled "Statistical methods for multivariate functional data". This work was supervised by Valentin Patilea (CREST, <a href="http://ensai.fr/equipe/valentin-patilea/">link</a>) and Nicolas Klutchnikoff (IRMAR, <a href="https://klutchnikoff.github.io">link</a>) and was realized part at Renault and part at ENSAI.
