I am a PhD student of statistics at Groupe Renault. I depend on the ENSAI lab. My research interests include functional data analysis, non-parametric statistics and machine learning. My thesis supervisors are Mr Valentin Patilea (CREST, [link](http://ensai.fr/equipe/valentin-patilea/)) and Mr Nicolas Klutchnikoff (IRMAR, [link](https://klutchnikoff.github.io)).

I also love playing basketball.
