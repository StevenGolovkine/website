abstract: "We introduce the Python package, FDApy, as an implementation of functional data. This package provide modules for the analysis of such data. It includes classes for different dimensional data as well as irregularly sampled functional data. A simulation toolbox is also provided. It might be used to simulate different clusters of functional data. Some methodologies to handle these data are implemented, such as dimension reduction and clustering. New methods can be easily added. The package is publicly available on the Python Package Index and Github."
