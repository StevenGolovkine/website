This [book](https://stevengolovkine.github.io/ISLR/) aims to provide my results to the different exercises of *An Introduction to Statistical Learning, with Application in R*, by James, Witten, Hastie and Tibshirani [1]. The applied exercises will be solved using the packages from the tidyverse (https://www.tidyverse.org) when it is possible.

This book is compiled using R Markdown and bookdown (https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown).
