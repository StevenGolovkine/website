summary: Multivariate functional data clustering using unsupervised binary trees.

abstract: "We propose a model-based clustering algorithm for a general class of functional data. The random functional data realizations could be measured with error at discrete, and possibly random, points in the definition domain. The idea is to build a set of binary trees by recursive splitting of the observations. The number of groups are determined in a data-driven way. The algorithm provides easily interpretable results and fast predictions for online data sets. Results on simulated datasets reveal good performance in various complex settings."
